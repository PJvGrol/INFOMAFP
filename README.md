# INFOMAFP
Project for the Advanced Functional Programming

# TODO
1. Create the initial cabal project with Charts library added and running. (Follow best practices).
2. Define input file structure
3. Define data structure


# Requirements
1. Default fallback if properties are not provided. This enables fast and easy setup, but still allows for customisation.
2. Keep the input file type modular (Easy support for XML, YAML in the future).
3. Error messages on json level - invalid structure, missing values etc.
4. Error messages on model level - data structure does not match grapgh type etc.
5. Include file output type of the graph (SVG, PNG etc.) in the input file (Also with default).
